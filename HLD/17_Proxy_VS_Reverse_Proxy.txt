Proxy Servers


Proxy Server::

Proxy is something which takes requests on the behalf of someone. It acts as an intermediate between clients and severs.

Client1----->   Proxy Server ----> Server 
       <-----                <----
Client2<-----                <-----


Proxy can take request from more than one clients and ask the server to get the desired data.

Types of Proxy Server
1. Forward Proxy
 It is sometime known as simple proxy.

Group of networks
/clients

Client1

Client2------> Proxy  --->Internet-----> Server
       <-----  Forward <---       <-----
Client3

Forward proxy hides the client networks.

Servers they don't know the client internal network.
Proxy will send its own Ip address to the outer world, not the actual ip of the client.
No server can knows the ip of client. They only knows the ip of proxy server.

Advantages::
1. It gives anonymous.
2. Grouping of requests.
3. Access restrited data/content.
4. Security
5. Caching

Disadvantage:
1. It works on application level.
For Example if you have 10 applications, then for each application you have to setup a proxy.
2. 

2. Reverse Proxy 


Internet----> Reverse Proxy-----> Server1
                                  Server2
                                  Server3

When ever request come from internet it is not allowed directly to the servers.
It goes to reverse proxy. And reverse proxy takes responsibility of talk to server.

Advantage::

1. Security(they don't know the server ip)
they only knows reverse proxy ip. It can handle DDoS attack.
CDN is a reverse proxy.
2. Caching (It first check the cache to complete the request).
3. Latency
4. Load Balancer




Proxy VS VPN

Proxy::

Client---> Proxy----> Server
          anonymous(It hides Ip address)
          Caching
          Logging

VPN::

Client----> VPN client----------
                     VPN tunnel   VPN Server 
                     ------------

VPN client do encryption of data. All the data goes as encrypted data into VPN tunnel.


Reverse Proxy Vs Load Balancer

Proxy::
It do IP anonymous,Cachine,Logging.
Reverse Proxy can act as a load balancer.

Load Balancer::

Load Balancer can not be a proxy.


Proxy VS FireWall

FireWall::
It can do packet scanning.

Proxy::
It works on application level.
It mainly used as anonymous.
Proxy can act as firewall also.
