Application Layer
1. Client Server Protocol
   a. HTTP
      1 Connection
   b. FTP
      2 Connections
         Controller Connection
         Data Connection
   c. SMTP
      SMTP is used for sending the mail.
      IMAP is used to receiving the mail.
   d. Web Sockets

One Web browser which is called Client
One Web Server which is called as a server

Client ---> Request  ---> Server
       <--- Response <---  



WebSocket is different then HTTP,FTP,SMTP 

WebSocket is  a bidirectional, means client can talk to server and server can talk to client

Client ------>Server
       <------

Note:: WebSocket is not a peer to peer.


       Server

Client             Client

In the above server can talk to both clients and both clients can tal to server but client to client communication is not possible.

2. Peer to Peer Protocol
   a. WebRTC


       Server

Client             Client


In peer to peer all can talk to each other
Server to client
Client to client



TransPort Layer/NetWork Layer
1. TCP/IP
In TCP/IP will maintain a virtual connection. Data will be transfered through that virtual connection. 
In this data will delevered in order.
There is an acknowledgement for each packets.
2. UDP/IP
In UDP/IP no connection will be maintined.
It will send to multiple virtual connection.
In this data will not be delevered in order.
UDP is fast.
There is an no acknowledgement.


WebRTC Uses UDP to transfer data. It is used in video sharing applications.
