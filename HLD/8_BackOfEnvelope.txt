Back Of Envelope

Estimation of FaceBook

What is Back of Envelope(BOE) Estimation?


LB   ----> CDN
     ----> Multiple Servers ---> DB (Capacity)
     ----> CACHE



Neither under utilize the resources. neither over utilize the resources.
Other it will be wastes of resources.

It drives our decision in system design.


Consideration::
1. These are rough numbers (T-Shirt Size). It is not acutual , It is just a rough estimation.

2. Keep the assumption values simple.


Cheat Sheet

          Traffic    Storage
 
3Zero     Thousand    KB
6Zero     Million     MB
9Zero     Billion     GB
12 Zero   Trillion    TB
15 Zero   Quadralion  PB



Three things to compute::

No Of Servers
RAM
Storage Capacity

Estimate of FaceBook


1. Traffic Estimation:: 


Total User: --> 1Billion
DAU(Daily Active User):--> 25% of total users
                            250 Million Users

In any system we have read operation and write operation.

5+2--> 7 queries

(250 Million Users * 7 Queries)/(60*60*24)==>864000 User  ~= 
  DAU  

==> 18 K query per second


2. Storage Assumption::

--> Every DAU doing 2 posts (every post of 250 characters)

-->10 % of User upload 1 image(300 KB of size)

1 Post--> 250 characters

          250 *2 bytes==> 500 bytes

for 2 post ==> 500*2==> 1000byes==> 1KB



250 Million Users*1KB==>      250 GB
    6Zero          3 Zero      


25 Million Users * 300KB         7500 GB==> 
   6Zeor              3Zero    

                               ==> 7000GB==> 8TB
 


Store data for 5years  ~==> 1825~==> 2000days

POST 2000 *250 GB ==> 500TB 
 
Image 2000*8T  ==> 16PB


3. RAM Estimation::
 For each user last 5 post we are putting in cache
  1 Post==> 500 Bytes

  5*500 ==> 2500 Bytes 

250 Million * 2500Bytes==> 
    DAU       (3KB)


250 Million * 3KB   ==> 750 GB  (Memory Space)
    6Zero      3Zero 


If 1 machine can hold 75GB od data. Then we need 10 Machines for Cachine.


Latency:: 95% ==> 500 milliseconds


18K request/Second


1 Server has 50 threads

1Second ==> 2 (500 millisecond)

==> 100 Request/Second


How many Server
==> 18K/100  ==> 180 servers
