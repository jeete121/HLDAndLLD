SQL or NoSQL? Which one to use and when?



SQL     NOSQL


SQL::
a. SQL(Structures Query Language), which is used to query relational database management system(RDBMS).
b. It has table, rows, columns. And there are relation in multiple table.

1. Structure
a. It maintained table, rows, columns.
b. It has predetermined Schema before you start using it.
c. It has relations between different tables.

2. Nature

Server 1
       
   Table 1                Table 3
   (Some data here)    (Some data here)

             Table 2
          (Some data here)
Data present in all table should present on the same server.
Whole data should present on the same server. Not on the different servers.

It means nature is concentrated/centralized

3. Scalability

There are two ways to scale one is Vertical and another one is Horizontal.
In Vertical:: We can increase the RAM Size.
              We can increase the Storage 
Capacity.
It fits much better to SQL.

In Horizontal:: We can do sharding.
                We can do sharding on the basis of rows or columns.
By sharding we can store partial data on the servers, means we can save some table data on server A and other on server B.

And Even certain columns data present on server A and certain columsn data present on different server(server B) of the same table.
It is not well supported in SQL.


4. Property

ACID properties
A --> Atomicity
C --> Consitency
I --> Isolation
D --> Durability

It makes sure of data integrity/consistent.



NOSQL:: 

Non relational/NoSQL/Not Only SQL.

1. Structure
It works in unstructured data.

a. Key-Value DB

Key    Value( value is Opaque)

Opaque::
You only search/query based on key.
We can't search/query based on value.

b. Dcoument DB 

It also has key and value.
In value it has json,xml,etc..

We can search/query based on key as well value.

c. ColumnWise DB

In this we have key, value is column value

 key  --> Value
           col1:: value
           col2:: value
            col3:: value

Means Value is the list of column value pair.


d. Graph DB

Data is store in Node Edge

      frient
Node1 -----> node2---->
     edge         ---->


It is used in Social networking, Recommendation Engine.

2. Nature

Data can we store in multiple nodes/servers

It is ditributed in nature.

3. Scale

Horizontal Scale.

We can store any number of nodes/servers.


4. Property
It is following BASE.

BA --> Basically Available
S  --> Safe State
E  --> Eventual Consitency


BA --> Basically Available
 
Basically available means it is highly available DB. It measn NoSQL is Highly available DB.

Because data is present in distributed. Replication happens.


S --> Safe State

State of data can be change without interaction.

Because sync will happen between nodes.


E--> Eventual Consitency

If we query we may get stale data/old data.
If we query again we might get the latest data.



When to use?

  SQL                  NoSQL
1.Flexible Query        1. Does not support.
  functionlity            (In advance know
                           which columns).
 
2. Relational Nature    2.  Non Relational
                            nature.

3. Data integrity       3. ACID not followed
   /Consitency (ACID)

4. Availability         4. High availability
                            /High Performance
                           (with some 
                             inconsitency)
